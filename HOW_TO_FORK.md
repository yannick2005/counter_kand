# How to copy the candidate repository
## Goal  
This manual describes how a candidate of the module 109 can copy this repository into their personal work environment.  

## Prerequisites  
To execute the following steps the following requirements must be met: 
- Have a personal GitHub account
- Have the [git](https://git-scm.com/) application locally installed
- Have a sophisticated text editor (e.g. [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) locally installed 

## Important git terminology
- Repository: the database, where all files and meta information are stored  
- Working copy: a location, private to an individual, containing copies of files in use  
- Checkout: process to retrieve a working copy of files from a repository  
- Commit: store the current changes of the repository in a new commit along with a log message from the user describing the changes
- Update: bring the contents of a working copy inline with the repository  
- Branching: working in an alternative thread of changes without interfering the current main branch  

## Important git commands  
- git clone: creating a private working copy of a remote repository 
- git add: add changes to the commit area. All files in this area can now be versioned using the succeeding git commit command 
- git commit: assign a commit message and therefore version all files within the staging area 
- git status: check the current status of the repository. What files are in the commit area or modified 
- git push: push local changes to the central remote repository 
- git pull: pull remote changes to your local working copy 

## How to copy (fork) the candidate repository into your personal GitHub profile
1) Open GitHub and login with your personal GitHub account
2) Open the candidate [repository](https://github.com/modul-i-ch-109/counter_kand) on GitHub  
3) Within the repository use the option "fork" to create a copy of the current project within your personal GitHub profile ![fork_buttom](documentation/fork.png)
4) Select your personal GitHub profile as destination ![fork_destination](documentation/destination.png)
5) Now GitHub has copied the repository within your personal GitHub profile. This allows you to make changes independently of the original repository. If at a certain point you would like to copy back (merge) your changes back to the original project, you can use the merge request functionality within GitHub.
